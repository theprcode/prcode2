/*
AIM:
Write C++ program for storing appointment schedule for day.
Appointments are booked randomly using linked list.
Set start and end time and min and max duration for visit slot.
Write functions for:
a) Display free slots 
b) Book appointment 
c) Cancel appointment (check validity, time bounds, availability etc.) 
d) Sort list based on time
e) Sort list based on time using pointer manipulation

INPUT: 
    1. Name of visitor
	2. hourOfDay, start and end time 
	3. min and max duration for visit slot

OUTPUT:
	a) Display free slots 
	b) Book appointment 
	c) Cancel appointment (check validity, time bounds, availability etc.) 
	d) Sort list based on time
	e) Sort list based on time using pointer manipulation
